#~ exercise:
# -> create variables `a` and `b` with some integer values
# -> try doing the mathematical operations with them
# -> try division with two integers
# -> create variable `c`, give it some float value (2.0)
#    and try division with that

a=3
b=2
c=2.0
puts a+b
puts a-b
puts a*b
puts a/b
puts a/c
puts a%b
puts a**b

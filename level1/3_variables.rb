#^ 3. Variables

# variable is some word or name that holds a single value, we use them
# when we want to save some value and reuse it in some other place

# defining variables is very easy,
# just give it some name and assign it some value

# the symbol `=` is used for assignment

my_var = 123

#~ exercise:
# -> create `name` variable and store your name in it, capitalized
# -> call the variable

#^ 8. Comments

# simply put, comments are lines of code that dont get executed.
# on any given line, anything after a `#` will become a comment.
# they are used for explaining what your code is supposed to be doing.

# full line comment example

actual = 'code' # some comment following code that will get executed

=begin
  multiline comments can also be declared like this,
  everything between `=begin` and `=end` will be a comment
=end

#! these are also regular comments
#* im just using an extension
#^ that is changing their color
#~ to make them more cool

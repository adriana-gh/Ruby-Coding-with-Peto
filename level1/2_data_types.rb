#^ 2. Data Types

# computer programs quickly analyze and manipulate data
# and because of that we need to understand what different
# type of data we can use in our programs

# for now we focus on these 3 types:

#* numeric -> some number
123 # integer -> number without a decimal
1.23 # float -> number with a decimal

#* boolean -> true or false
true
false

#* string -> some text
'some text'
'123' # number in quotes is also a string
'true' # boolean in quotes is also a string
"double quotes work too"
# while double quotes work, its preferable to use single quotes
# unless you actually need the double quotes - we will get to this situation later

#~ exercise:
# -> call some numbers, booleans or strings in the console
# -> notice the difference between what `true` and `'true'` returns
#    (or `1` and `'1'`)

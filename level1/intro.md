# What is programming?

in essence, its coming up with a set of instructions for the computer to execute

> 'coding' can be used interchangably, but its actually turning that idea into a written language the computer can understand

computer reads instructions very literally and its important to be specific about what you want it to do. for example if you wanted to tell the computer to add one tablespoon of salt to the water, youd first have to define what is a tablespoon, what is salt, what is water, where to find these things, how to get to them, what does 'add' mean, and so on until you get to the smallest possible step.

# What is ruby?

ruby is a object oriented programming language created with the purpose of having a language thats easily readable by people. code written in ruby often reads as normal english sentences and because of that its in my opinion very good for beginners to start with.

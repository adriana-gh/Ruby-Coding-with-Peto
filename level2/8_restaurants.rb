#^ 8. Restaurants

# This is the final exercise of level 2, and concludes
# the introduction to basics of programming in ruby.

# You'll be building a very simplified restaurant
# management system. The restaurant will have a name
# and items for sale. Items will have name, price
# and stock level. The restaurant will be able to
# add more items for sale, remove existing items,
# and place orders. When placing an order, item names
# and quantities will be provided, if some items
# are out of stock, you should return an error message,
# and if they are all available return the total
# price of the order, and reduce the stock
# of the ordered items.

# Bonus points for the ability to apply discount
# to individual order items, or to the whole order,
# but not both. If discount is applied to both
# items and the order, it should return an error
# message.

# Extra bonus points for following rubocop guidelines.

# In level2/restaurants/tests.rb you can find a test
# suite and instructions on how to use it. To successfully
# complete this task make sure the tests are passing,
# or optionally passing with bonus, and then open a pull
# request to the coding classes repo with your solution.

# In level2/restaurants/peto_tests.rb you can find an
# example of how the test suite is supposed to be working.
